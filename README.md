SunCheck
===========

A weather visualization app

Spec
=====
Build an app that analyzes and displays weather information for one location.
 - The user’s current location is taken as the default. The user is allowed to override the default.

The user is able to specify a time period to obtain weather information of interest, which includes:
 - The percent of sunny days during the time period
 - Visualization of temperature throughout the time period
 - Visualization of rainfall throughout the time period
 - Anything else that might be interesting without sacrificing the usability of the app

What are we interested in seeing?
 - Good, clean code that works. Corner cases should be properly handled or explained. It doesn’t have to work for every situation (eg, IE), but you should be able to explain all limitations.
 - Attention to design and usability. The spec is ambiguous on purpose -- use your judgement while you are building. It's ok to ask questions.
 - Test coverage. You don’t need to test everything, but we’d like to see that you know what merits a test and why.
 - Your workflow and interaction with git.
